# Explain how the bit selection works for the alternatives that are controlled by the RegDst control signal. Which instructions are using what logic and why?
With a multiplexer, RegDst chooses either rt (top) or rd (bottom) as the input to A3, which is the register to be written to. R-type instructions (like add) writes to rd while I-type instructions (like addi) writes to rt.

# Explain how the beq instruction is implemented, how the address is calculated, and how the signals are controlled by the control unit.
It first checks if the values in the two registers are equal by subtracting them and then sending out a zero flag if the result is zero. If the result was zero and the branch flag is set to 1 by the control unit it chooses an alternate new value for the PC, which is PC + 4 + 4*signext(imm).
